## Install

Be sure to have composer installed on your system: http://getcomposer.org/

After cloning this repo, perform:
```
composer install
```

If you have a webserver, such as apache, direct your webserver to have the `public/` directory as the web root.

For development purposes, you can test your code with `php -S localhost:1234 -t public/` and your site will be available at http://localhost:1234/

To gather and deploy data periodically (in JSON files in /public/parking), add the following line to your crontab:

```
* * * * * /bin/php [REPO]/cron.php 1>> /dev/null 2>&1
```

Replace /bin/php with your PHP interpreter binary if you have it located somewhere else, and replace [REPO]
with the path to the repository on your system.
